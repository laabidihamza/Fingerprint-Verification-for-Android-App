# Fingerprint Verification for Android App

This repository contains an Android app that demonstrates how to implement fingerprint verification in an Android app using Kotlin.

## Features

- Uses BiometricPrompt API for fingerprint authentication
- Provides error handling for different biometric scenarios
- Supports multiple authentication outcomes: success, error, and failure
- Handles cases where the device does not have fingerprint hardware, fingerprint hardware is unavailable, or no fingerprints are enrolled
- Demonstrates the usage of Executor for handling authentication callbacks on the main thread
